	Version 0.1.0

	This version implements the HOTP and TOTP algorithms, as well as a key URI
	parser to interact with the algorithms.

	Currently there is no account storage or user interface.  This version
	mostly serves as a frontend to the HOTP and TOTP algorithms.

	Since there is no user interface, the key URI is passed to the program
	through the first argument.  The program will log the resulting generated
	passcode to the terminal.

	The plans for future versions are as follows:

		0.2.0 - Implement persistent encrypted account storage on disk

		0.3.0 - Implement a basic terminal TUI which supports non-ANSI terminals
		
		0.4.0 - Implement an advanced terminal TUI which requires ANSI support

	Version 0.1.0+setup

	This version doesn't contain any real program functionality.  It exists for
	a "clean" base with the build system set up.
