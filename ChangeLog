	Version 0.1.1

	This version mostly focueses on cleanup and correction of mistakes caught
	after the release of 0.1.0.

	The only changes relevant to end-users is a couple of minor bugs resulting
	from mistakes and typos in the code.  The only intended difference in
	functionality is making argument parsing return
	CLIAUTH_ARGS_PARSE_RESULT_INVALID if key URI parsing fails.  The old
	behavior was to return CLIAUTH_ARGS_PARSE_RESULT_MISSING if a required part
	of the key URI was missing.

	For developers or those planning on building from source, the automake
	script was updated to include headers as part of the source list.  In
	0.1.0,  this was not done, which resulted in issues with running 'make
	dist'.  This has been corrected due to the above change.

	The plans for future versions remain unchanged from 0.1.0.

	Version 0.1.0

	This version implements the HOTP and TOTP algorithms, as well as a key URI
	parser to interact with the algorithms.

	Currently there is no account storage or user interface.  This version
	mostly serves as a frontend to the HOTP and TOTP algorithms.

	Since there is no user interface, the key URI is passed to the program
	through the first argument.  The program will log the resulting generated
	passcode to the terminal.

	The plans for future versions are as follows:

		0.2.0 - Implement persistent encrypted account storage on disk

		0.3.0 - Implement a basic terminal TUI which supports non-ANSI terminals
		
		0.4.0 - Implement an advanced terminal TUI which requires ANSI support

	Version 0.1.0+setup

	This version doesn't contain any real program functionality.  It exists for
	a "clean" base with the build system set up.
