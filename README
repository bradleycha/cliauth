CliAuth is a program for managing accounts which use 2-factor authentication
through TOPT.  It is designed to be minimal and portable while still providing
enough functionality to be a primary authenticator used for real accounts.

WARNING: Account database files must be backed up manually.  If an account
database file is corrupted or the password is lost, all attached accounts will
be unaccessible without further recovery efforts.
